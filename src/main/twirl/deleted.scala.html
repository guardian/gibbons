          <br>
          GDPR requires the Guardian to delete API keys periodically, unless the user confirms that they wish to keep using their key.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, we sent you an email asking whether you were still using your API key, but we haven't heard back from you. As requested by the legislation, your key has been deleted and can no longer be used to access the Guardian's Open Platform.</p>
